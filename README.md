# Covid Deaths Data Analysis using SQL

Welcome to the Covid Deaths Data Analysis repository! This repository focuses on analyzing Covid deaths data using SQL to gain insights into mortality rates, regional patterns, and demographic impacts. By leveraging SQL queries, we can extract valuable information from the dataset and contribute to informed decision-making in public health strategies and pandemic response.

## Features

- **Data Import**: Import the Covid deaths dataset into a SQL database for analysis. Ensure data integrity and consistency.

- **Data Cleaning**: Cleanse the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats. Ensure data quality for accurate analysis.

- **Data Exploration**: Use SQL queries to explore the Covid deaths data and gain insights into mortality rates over time, demographic factors, and regional patterns. Analyze trends, patterns, and distributions.


## Usage

1. **Data Import**: Import the Covid deaths dataset into your SQL database. Ensure proper database configuration and data integrity.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleanse the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats. Ensure data quality for accurate analysis.

3. **Data Exploration**: Use SQL queries to explore the Covid deaths data. Analyze mortality rates, demographic impacts, and regional patterns. Extract relevant information for deeper insights.
